# ei9h7's dotfiles

My configuration. Minimalist, but helps save a few thousand keystrokes a day. I use macOS and ParrotOS, so I can only guarantee they'll work on a Mac with recent OS and Debian based Linux distros, but they seem to be pretty flexible.

You may also be interested in my [Automated Machine Setup Ansible Playbook](https://github.com/ei9h7/automated-machine-setup), which configures my personal machnes from scratch using Ansible, and incorporates the installation and updating of a set of dotfiles like this one.

I based my initial dotfiles on [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)' excellent
[dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), just removing his bootstrap and install scripts and replacing with [Tom Payne](https://github.com/twpayne)'s [chezmois](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/) dotfiles tool. Eventually replaced by Ansible for automation, using [Jeff Geerling's](https://github.com/geerlingguy/dotfiles) scripts to build off of. Other dotfile code inspiration has come from:
